## Introduction

Comments are the gold standard of LinkedIn engagement. Unlike likes or reactions, comments represent genuine interest, spark conversations, and significantly boost your post's visibility in the algorithm. A post with meaningful comments can reach 10x more people than one with only likes.

In this guide, you'll learn proven techniques to write LinkedIn posts that inspire people to comment, share their thoughts, and engage in meaningful professional discussions.

## Why Comments Matter on LinkedIn

Comments are powerful for several reasons:

### Algorithm Boost

- Comments signal high-quality, engaging content
- The LinkedIn algorithm prioritizes posts with active discussions
- Each comment can expand your reach to the commenter's network

### Relationship Building

- Comments create opportunities for meaningful connections
- Engaging with commenters builds your professional network
- Thoughtful responses establish you as a thought leader

### Content Amplification

- Posts with comments appear in more feeds
- Active discussions attract more viewers
- Comments can turn a single post into an ongoing conversation

## The Psychology of Comment-Worthy Posts

Understanding what makes people want to comment:

1. **Relatability**: Posts that resonate with common experiences
2. **Controversy**: Thought-provoking takes that spark debate
3. **Value**: Actionable insights people want to discuss
4. **Questions**: Direct invitations to share opinions
5. **Stories**: Personal narratives that inspire responses

## 10 Proven Techniques to Get More Comments

### Technique 1: Start with a Hook

Your first line determines if people read further:

**Weak opening:**
"I wanted to share some thoughts about leadership..."

**Strong opening:**
"I made a $50,000 mistake in my first month as CEO. Here's what I learned..."

The hook should:

- Create curiosity
- Promise value
- Relate to your audience
- Be specific and concrete

### Technique 2: End with a Question

Questions are the simplest way to invite comments:

**Examples:**

- "What's been your biggest challenge with [topic]?"
- "Have you experienced something similar? I'd love to hear your story."
- "What would you add to this list?"
- "What's your take on [controversial topic]?"

**Pro tip**: Make questions specific and easy to answer. Avoid yes/no questions.

### Technique 3: Share Personal Stories

Personal stories create emotional connections:

**Structure:**

1. Set the scene (context)
2. Describe the challenge or situation
3. Share the outcome or lesson learned
4. Invite others to share similar experiences

**Example:**
"Last week, I had to fire someone for the first time in my career. It was harder than I expected. The conversation taught me that leadership isn't about being liked—it's about doing what's right for the team. Have you faced a similar difficult decision? How did you handle it?"

### Technique 4: Create Controversy (Thoughtfully)

Controversial takes generate discussion:

**Safe controversy:**

- Challenge industry norms
- Question common practices
- Offer counterintuitive insights
- Debate best practices

**Avoid:**

- Personal attacks
- Offensive content
- Divisive political topics (unless relevant to your industry)

**Example:**
"Hot take: Most 'thought leadership' on LinkedIn is just repackaged common sense. Real insights come from experience, not from reading the same articles everyone else reads. What's your take—is LinkedIn content getting too generic?"

### Technique 5: Use Lists and Formatting

Well-formatted posts are easier to engage with:

- Use **bold text** to highlight key points (learn [how to add bold text](/blog/how-to-add-bold-text-to-linkedin-posts))
- Create numbered lists for actionable tips
- Use bullet points for scannable content ([how to add bullet lists](/blog/how-to-add-bullet-point-lists-to-linkedin-posts))
- Break up text with line breaks

### Technique 6: Offer Actionable Value

Posts that teach something get saved and commented on:

**Structure:**

1. Identify a common problem
2. Share a solution or framework
3. Provide actionable steps
4. Ask how readers have solved it differently

**Example:**
"3 ways to handle difficult client conversations:

1. Listen first, respond second
2. Acknowledge their concerns before defending
3. Propose solutions, not excuses

Which technique works best for you?"

### Technique 7: Use the "Agree or Disagree" Framework

Simple frameworks invite quick engagement:

**Examples:**

- "Agree or disagree: [controversial statement]"
- "Which do you prefer: [Option A] or [Option B]?"
- "True or false: [industry belief]"

These are easy to answer and often spark longer comments explaining why.

### Technique 8: Share Mistakes and Lessons

Vulnerability creates connection:

**Structure:**

1. Admit a mistake or failure
2. Explain what you learned
3. Share how it changed your approach
4. Ask others to share their learning moments

**Example:**
"I used to think networking was about collecting business cards. I was wrong. Real networking is about building genuine relationships. My biggest mistake? Focusing on quantity over quality. What's a networking mistake you've made and learned from?"

### Technique 9: Create "Add to This List" Posts

Invite contributions to your content:

**Example:**
"5 signs you're working with a great manager:

1. They give credit, not take it
2. They invest in your growth
3. They communicate clearly
4. They handle conflict directly
5. They lead by example

What would you add to this list?"

### Technique 10: Use Polls Strategically

LinkedIn polls generate high engagement:

- Ask industry-relevant questions
- Follow up with posts analyzing results
- Use poll insights to create discussion posts

## The Comment-Friendly Post Structure

Here's a proven structure that gets comments:

### 1. Hook (First Line)

Grab attention immediately

### 2. Context (2-3 Sentences)

Set up your story or point

### 3. Value/Insight (Main Body)

Share your key message with formatting:

- **Bold** key points
- Use lists for clarity
- Break up text

### 4. Question or Call to Action

Invite engagement

### 5. Hashtags (3-5 relevant)

Help discovery

## Responding to Comments to Boost Engagement

### Respond Quickly

The first hour is critical:

- Respond to comments within 15-30 minutes
- Early responses signal active engagement
- Algorithm favors posts with active discussions

### Respond Thoughtfully

Quality over speed:

- Acknowledge the commenter's point
- Add value to the conversation
- Ask follow-up questions
- Thank people for sharing

### Engage with Everyone

Don't just respond to easy comments:

- Address challenging questions
- Engage with different perspectives
- Build on commenters' insights
- Create a welcoming discussion space

## Common Mistakes That Kill Comments

### Mistake 1: Being Too Salesy

**Avoid:**

- Direct sales pitches
- Overly promotional language
- Hard sells in posts

**Instead:**

- Focus on value first
- Share insights, not products
- Let your expertise sell itself

### Mistake 2: Making It Too Long

**Problem:**

- Walls of text are hard to read
- People scroll past long posts
- Mobile users especially skip long content

**Solution:**

- Keep posts under 1,300 characters
- Use formatting to break up text
- Save longer thoughts for LinkedIn Articles

### Mistake 3: Not Asking for Engagement

**Problem:**

- Assuming people will comment naturally
- Not providing clear invitation
- Ending posts without a question

**Solution:**

- Always end with a question
- Make it easy to answer
- Be specific about what you want

### Mistake 4: Ignoring Comments

**Problem:**

- Not responding to comments
- Generic responses
- Missing the engagement window

**Solution:**

- Respond to every comment
- Be genuine and thoughtful
- Engage in the first hour

## Advanced Strategies for Maximum Comments

### Strategy 1: Create Series Posts

Series build anticipation:

- Number your posts (Part 1, Part 2, etc.)
- Reference previous posts
- Ask readers what they want in the next part

### Strategy 2: Use "This or That" Frameworks

Simple choices generate engagement:

- "Which do you prefer: [A] or [B]?"
- "Would you rather [Option 1] or [Option 2]?"
- "Team [X] or Team [Y]?"

### Strategy 3: Share Data and Ask for Interpretation

Data posts invite analysis:

- Share interesting statistics
- Ask what the data means
- Invite different perspectives

### Strategy 4: Create "Fill in the Blank" Posts

Easy engagement format:

- "The best career advice I ever received was: **\_**"
- "If I could tell my younger self one thing, it would be: **\_**"
- "The most underrated skill in [industry] is: **\_**"

## Measuring Comment Success

Track these metrics:

1. **Comment rate**: Comments / Impressions
2. **Response rate**: Your responses / Total comments
3. **Comment quality**: Length and thoughtfulness of comments
4. **Engagement depth**: Replies to comments (thread depth)

Aim for:

- 2-5% comment rate (industry average is ~1%)
- 100% response rate to comments
- Comments that are 20+ words (meaningful engagement)
