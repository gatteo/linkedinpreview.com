## Why the Right Prompt Changes Everything

An AI writing tool is only as good as the instruction you give it. Type "write me a LinkedIn post about leadership" and you will get a generic, forgettable paragraph that sounds like a press release. Give the same tool a specific, well-structured prompt and you get a post with a genuine hook, a clear point of view, and a question that invites comments.

The difference is not the model. It is the prompt.

This article gives you 50 ready-to-use prompts organized by content type. Each prompt is designed to work with AI generators — including the one built into this site — to produce LinkedIn posts that match your voice, your audience, and your goals. You do not need any prompt-writing experience. Pick the category that fits what you want to post today, copy the prompt, personalize the bracketed details, and generate.

A few things to keep in mind before you start:

- **Replace the brackets.** Every prompt uses `[placeholders]` for details specific to you. The more specific you make them, the better the output.
- **Tone matters.** After you paste a prompt, select a tone that fits your brand — professional, conversational, bold — before generating.
- **Treat the output as a draft.** AI gives you a strong starting point. Spend two minutes reading it and adding one or two personal details that only you could write.
- **Format before you post.** Once you have a post you like, run it through the preview tool to check how it reads on mobile and desktop, and add any [bold text or formatting](/blog/linkedin-posts-text-formatting) that makes key lines stand out.

## Thought Leadership Prompts

Thought leadership posts share your perspective on an industry trend, challenge a common assumption, or predict where your field is heading. They position you as someone worth following — not just someone who shares articles.

Use these prompts when you want to establish credibility, attract followers in your niche, or start a professional conversation.

---

**Prompt 1**

> Write a LinkedIn post where I challenge the common belief that [widely accepted industry practice] is the best approach. I believe [your contrarian view] because [your reason]. My audience is [describe your audience]. End with a question asking whether they agree or disagree.

**When to use it:** Anytime you hold a view that goes against the grain in your field. Contrarian takes reliably generate comments because readers feel compelled to respond — whether they agree or want to push back.

---

**Prompt 2**

> Write a LinkedIn post predicting the 3 biggest changes in [your industry] over the next [12 months / 3 years]. Each prediction should include a brief reason why. My background is [your role/experience]. Tone: confident but not alarmist.

**When to use it:** At the start of a new year, quarter, or after a major industry event. Prediction posts perform especially well because people save and share them to revisit later.

---

**Prompt 3**

> Write a LinkedIn post about a lesson I learned after [number] years working in [your field]. The core insight is [your lesson]. I want to frame it as advice I wish someone had given me earlier. Keep it under 250 words and end with a question for my audience.

**When to use it:** When you want to share hard-won wisdom in a way that feels personal rather than prescriptive. Framing experience as "what I wish I knew" tends to generate strong engagement.

---

**Prompt 4**

> Write a LinkedIn post reacting to this industry trend: [describe trend or paste a headline]. My take is [your perspective]. I want to add context that most people are missing, which is [your insight]. My audience is [describe audience]. Avoid buzzwords.

**When to use it:** When something significant happens in your industry and you want to add analysis rather than just sharing a link. Original commentary on current events outperforms simple reshares.

---

**Prompt 5**

> Write a LinkedIn post titled "The [number] skills nobody talks about in [your field]." List the skills with a short explanation for each. My experience is [your background]. Avoid cliches like "communication" and "time management." End by asking readers what they would add.

**When to use it:** When you want a high-value list post that stands out by being specific and non-obvious. List posts with a surprising or counterintuitive angle tend to get saved and shared.

---

**Prompt 6**

> Write a LinkedIn post sharing my opinion on why [common career advice] is often bad advice for [specific type of professional]. I believe [your alternative view]. Keep the tone direct but not preachy. End with an invitation to debate.

**When to use it:** When you have a strong professional opinion you have been hesitant to share publicly. A well-argued counterintuitive post is one of the fastest ways to grow an engaged following.

---

**Prompt 7**

> Write a LinkedIn post about the state of [your industry] right now. Acknowledge what is working, be honest about what is broken, and share what I think needs to change. My perspective comes from [your background]. Aim for 200-250 words.

**When to use it:** For "big picture" posts that position you as someone who thinks at a strategic level. These work particularly well for founders, consultants, and senior practitioners.

---

**Prompt 8**

> Write a LinkedIn post framing [a framework, model, or approach you use] as a way to solve [a common problem in your field]. Explain the framework in 3 clear steps. My audience is [describe audience]. End with an offer to share more detail in the comments.

**When to use it:** When you want to share original thinking in a structured format. Frameworks and models are highly shareable because they give readers a mental model they can use and reference.

---

**Prompt 9**

> Write a LinkedIn post about a mistake that is very common in [your field] that most people never talk about. Explain what the mistake is, why people keep making it, and what to do instead. Keep the tone empathetic, not condescending. End with a question.

**When to use it:** Mistake-and-fix posts position you as a trusted expert. The empathetic framing ("here is why this happens") gets more engagement than a judgmental tone.

---

## Storytelling Prompts

Stories are the most powerful format on LinkedIn. A specific, honest story about your own experience will always outperform a generic tip post. These prompts help you turn your experiences — successes, failures, turning points, and observations — into posts people actually read.

---

**Prompt 10**

> Write a LinkedIn post telling the story of a time I failed at [specific situation]. The failure was [describe it briefly]. What I learned from it was [your lesson]. Structure it with a hook that starts mid-story, not with "I want to share a story about..." End with a question asking if others have had a similar experience.

**When to use it:** Whenever you want to build trust and connection. Vulnerability about real failures is consistently one of the most commented formats on LinkedIn when it is honest and specific.

---

**Prompt 11**

> Write a LinkedIn post about a moment that changed how I think about [topic]. The moment was [describe it]. Before this moment I believed [old belief]. After it I believed [new belief]. Keep it personal and avoid moralizing. Under 200 words.

**When to use it:** For a concise, punchy "turning point" post. These work well because they follow a narrative arc that readers find satisfying even in a short format.

---

**Prompt 12**

> Write a LinkedIn post telling the story of how I got into [your current career or field]. It was not a straight path — [briefly describe the non-linear route]. I want the tone to be honest and slightly self-deprecating. End with an invitation for others to share their path.

**When to use it:** Great for building community and relatability. "How I got here" posts invite dozens of replies because most people on LinkedIn have a non-linear career story too.

---

**Prompt 13**

> Write a LinkedIn post about a piece of advice someone gave me that turned out to be completely wrong for me, even though it is widely given. The advice was [the advice]. Why it did not work: [your reason]. What I did instead: [your alternative]. End with a reflection question.

**When to use it:** For a twist on the "lessons learned" format. Subverting conventional wisdom with personal experience creates more engagement than simply sharing the conventional wisdom.

---

**Prompt 14**

> Write a LinkedIn post about a professional moment I am genuinely proud of that I have never shared publicly before. The moment was [describe it]. I want to share it in a way that feels authentic rather than boastful. Keep it under 220 words and end with a question about what my readers are proud of but rarely talk about.

**When to use it:** When you want to share a win without sounding like a humblebrag. Framing a success as "something I have kept to myself" invites readers to do the same in the comments.

---

**Prompt 15**

> Write a LinkedIn post about something that happened at [a specific point in my career] that I did not understand at the time but now see as a turning point. Frame it as a reflection, not a how-to. Tone: thoughtful, slightly nostalgic. End with a question about turning points.

**When to use it:** For reflective posts that tend to resonate most with mid-career and senior professionals. These posts often attract deeply personal responses.

---

**Prompt 16**

> Write a LinkedIn post structured as "I used to think [X]. Then [something happened]. Now I think [Y]." The topic is [your topic]. I want the post to show genuine change and growth, not just performative humility. Under 180 words.

**When to use it:** This three-part structure is one of the most efficient storytelling formats for LinkedIn. It is compact, honest, and easy for readers to relate to or respond to.

---

**Prompt 17**

> Write a LinkedIn post about a professional relationship — a mentor, colleague, manager, or client — who had a lasting impact on me. What they taught me was [the lesson]. I do not want to name them directly. Keep the tone grateful without being sentimental. End with a question about who influenced my readers.

**When to use it:** For posts that celebrate others while sharing your own growth. These often generate replies naming people who inspired your readers, creating a warm, positive comment thread.

---

**Prompt 18**

> Write a LinkedIn post about the hardest professional decision I ever made. The decision was [describe it broadly]. I want to share what made it difficult and what I would do the same or differently now. Tone: honest, not dramatic. End with a question about difficult decisions.

**When to use it:** Hard decision posts attract engaged, thoughtful comments because most professionals have faced similar moments and want to compare notes.

## Educational Prompts

Educational posts — how-tos, tip lists, step-by-step guides — are LinkedIn's most shared format. They get saved by people who want to come back to them and shared by people who want to be helpful to their own network. These prompts help you turn your expertise into content that provides clear, immediate value.

---

**Prompt 19**

> Write a LinkedIn post explaining how to [accomplish a specific task or solve a specific problem] in [number] steps. My audience is [describe audience]. Each step should be one to two sentences. End with a question asking what step my readers find most challenging. Avoid jargon.

**When to use it:** For any process you know well. Step-by-step posts perform well because they are scannable and immediately actionable.

---

**Prompt 20**

> Write a LinkedIn post sharing [number] things I wish I had known before [starting a role, launching a business, entering an industry]. Frame each point as practical advice, not regret. My audience is people who are [early in their career / just starting in this field]. End by asking what they wish they had known.

**When to use it:** "What I wish I knew" posts tap into the universal desire to learn from others' experience. They work especially well if your audience includes people a few years behind you in their career.

---

**Prompt 21**

> Write a LinkedIn post explaining [a concept, tool, or method] in plain language for someone who has no background in [your field]. Use an analogy if it helps. The concept is [describe it]. Keep it under 250 words and end with a question checking understanding or inviting questions.

**When to use it:** When you want to explain something complex to a broad audience. Posts that make expert knowledge accessible attract both peers who appreciate the clarity and newcomers who learn from it.

---

**Prompt 22**

> Write a LinkedIn post debunking [number] myths about [topic in your field]. For each myth, state the myth clearly and then explain the truth. My audience is [describe audience]. Tone: direct and confident, not lecturing. End with an invitation to share other myths.

**When to use it:** Myth-busting posts generate strong engagement because readers react both to myths they believed and to ones they think should have made the list.

---

**Prompt 23**

> Write a LinkedIn post sharing a framework I use to make decisions about [topic]. The framework has [number] elements: [list them briefly]. Explain each element in one to two sentences. I want the post to feel practical and replicable. End by asking readers what framework they use.

**When to use it:** When you want to share original thinking in a structured, memorable way. Frameworks get saved and referenced more than any other format.

---

**Prompt 24**

> Write a LinkedIn post with [number] quick tips for [specific skill or challenge]. Each tip should be one to two sentences and immediately actionable. My audience is [describe audience]. Use a numbered list format. End with a question about which tip they will try first.

**When to use it:** For fast, high-value posts when you are short on time. Quick-tip lists also work well as content series where each post covers one tip in depth.

---

**Prompt 25**

> Write a LinkedIn post comparing [Option A] and [Option B] for [specific use case or goal]. Structure it as a balanced comparison with clear pros and cons for each, then share my recommendation and why. My recommendation is [your recommendation]. End with a question about which readers prefer.

**When to use it:** Comparison posts generate strong engagement because readers hold opinions and want to weigh in. They also perform well in search because they match how people research decisions.

---

**Prompt 26**

> Write a LinkedIn post sharing what I have learned from reading [book, report, or study]. The main insight that surprised me was [insight]. I want to share this in a way that is useful even for people who will not read the original. Keep it under 230 words and end with a recommendation.

**When to use it:** For turning your reading habit into content. These posts position you as someone who invests in learning and help your audience absorb insights without extra effort.

---

**Prompt 27**

> Write a LinkedIn post explaining the difference between [two commonly confused concepts in your field]. Most people mix these up because [reason]. The real difference is [your explanation]. My audience is [describe audience]. Tone: clear and helpful, not condescending. End with a question.

**When to use it:** "Most people confuse these" posts attract high engagement because they are immediately useful. If you pick two concepts your audience genuinely confuses, you will get comments thanking you.

---

**Prompt 28**

> Write a LinkedIn post sharing a resource — a tool, template, article, or book — that has made a real difference to how I work. The resource is [name it]. Why it helps: [explain it briefly]. Who should use it: [your audience]. Keep it short — under 150 words — and end with a question about what resources others recommend.

**When to use it:** Resource posts generate comments because people love sharing their own recommendations. They also help you build goodwill by providing value with no strings attached.

---

## Engagement Prompts

Some posts are specifically designed to spark comments and discussion. These are not about sharing your expertise or your story — they are about creating a space for your audience to share theirs. Use these prompts when you want to build community, increase comment volume, or understand what your audience thinks.

For more on the mechanics of driving comments, see the guide on [how to write LinkedIn posts that get comments](/blog/how-to-write-linkedin-posts-that-get-comments).

---

**Prompt 29**

> Write a LinkedIn post asking my audience a question about [topic relevant to my field]. The question should be specific enough to have a real answer but open enough that many people will have different responses. Frame it with one to two sentences of context. Do not include my own answer — the post is entirely about asking theirs.

**When to use it:** Pure question posts are the fastest way to start a comment thread. Keep the setup brief and make the question specific — vague questions get vague answers.

---

**Prompt 30**

> Write a LinkedIn post using the "hot take" format on [topic]. Start with "Hot take:" and then state a view that most people in my field would find surprising or disagree with. Keep it under 100 words. End with "Agree or disagree?"

**When to use it:** Hot takes are short, provocative, and designed to generate reactions. Use them sparingly — no more than once a week — so they retain their edge.

---

**Prompt 31**

> Write a LinkedIn post using the "this or that" format for [topic]. Give my audience a clear choice between two options and ask them to pick one and explain why. Frame it in a way that is relevant to professionals in [your field]. Keep the whole post under 100 words.

**When to use it:** Binary choice posts are low-friction for readers — it is easy to pick a side. The "explain why" element turns a one-word response into a real comment.

---

**Prompt 32**

> Write a LinkedIn post using the "fill in the blank" format. The blank should complete the sentence: [your sentence with a blank]. The topic is [your topic]. I want people to complete the sentence in the comments. Keep the setup under 80 words.

**When to use it:** Fill-in-the-blank posts have one of the highest comment rates of any format because they are fun and fast to engage with. Pick a sentence where many different answers are valid.

---

**Prompt 33**

> Write a LinkedIn post sharing an "unpopular opinion" about [topic in my field]. Frame it honestly — explain that I know this might be controversial but I genuinely believe it. The opinion is [state it]. End by asking readers whether they share this view or think I am wrong.

**When to use it:** The "unpopular opinion" framing signals to readers that you are being candid, which invites candid responses. It also protects against pushback by acknowledging upfront that the view is contentious.

---

**Prompt 34**

> Write a LinkedIn post that starts a discussion about [a dilemma or tension in my field]. Present both sides fairly: [side A] and [side B]. Do not share my own view. End by asking where my readers stand and why.

**When to use it:** Balanced dilemma posts work especially well when there is genuine disagreement in your field. By withholding your own opinion, you signal that you are genuinely interested in what your audience thinks.

---

**Prompt 35**

> Write a LinkedIn post sharing an observation about something I noticed recently — at work, in my industry, or in professional culture — that made me think. The observation is [describe it]. I want the post to feel like the start of a conversation rather than a lecture. End with a question.

**When to use it:** Observation posts feel more natural and spontaneous than tip lists or frameworks. They work well when you want to share a thought without the overhead of a fully structured post.

---

**Prompt 36**

> Write a LinkedIn post that invites my audience to share their best advice on [topic]. Set it up with one personal sentence about why I am asking. Keep the whole post under 100 words. I want the comments section to become a resource.

**When to use it:** "Crowdsourced advice" posts build community and generate high-value comment threads. Readers feel genuinely useful contributing, which increases both the volume and quality of responses.

---

**Prompt 37**

> Write a LinkedIn post using the format "Am I the only one who [common professional experience]?" The experience I want to describe is [describe it]. I want readers to say yes if they relate and share their own version. Keep it under 120 words.

**When to use it:** This format works by activating the strong human desire to say "me too." It is most effective when the experience is genuinely common but rarely said aloud.

## Career and Growth Prompts

Career content performs consistently well on LinkedIn because professional development is the platform's core purpose. These prompts help you share what you have learned, celebrate milestones authentically, and build a reputation as someone worth following for career advice.

---

**Prompt 38**

> Write a LinkedIn post sharing what I have learned in my first [30/60/90 days / year] in [current role or company]. I want to be specific and honest — what surprised me, what was harder than expected, and what I am proud of. End with advice for anyone starting a similar role.

**When to use it:** Milestone posts mark transitions authentically. The specific, honest framing — including what was hard — makes these far more engaging than generic "I am thrilled to announce" posts.

---

**Prompt 39**

> Write a LinkedIn post about a skill that has made the biggest difference in my career that is not [obvious skill related to your field]. The skill is [name it]. Explain what it is, why most people underestimate it, and how to develop it. End with a question about what underrated skills readers value.

**When to use it:** Underrated skill posts are reliably popular because they offer a perspective that feels earned. The question at the end generates lists of skills in the comments that become useful for your entire audience.

---

**Prompt 40**

> Write a LinkedIn post about a career decision that looked bad from the outside but turned out to be the right call for me. The decision was [describe it]. Why it looked bad: [explain]. Why it was right: [explain]. I want to help others trust their own judgment. End with a reflection question.

**When to use it:** Counterintuitive career decision posts generate strong engagement because readers relate to moments of self-doubt and appreciate the reassurance that unconventional paths can work.

---

**Prompt 41**

> Write a LinkedIn post sharing [number] things I would do differently if I were starting my career today in [your field]. Be specific and practical — not "network more" but [an example of a specific action]. My audience is people who are early in their careers. End by asking what they would add.

**When to use it:** "Starting over" posts are reliably popular because they combine the authority of experience with the relatability of "I did not have it figured out either."

---

**Prompt 42**

> Write a LinkedIn post about how I handle [a common professional challenge like burnout, imposter syndrome, difficult feedback, career plateaus]. I want to share what has worked for me personally — not generic advice, but what I actually do. Keep the tone honest and practical. End with a question about how readers handle it.

**When to use it:** Personal coping strategy posts attract high engagement because they are both useful and human. The key is specificity — what you actually do, not what you think people should do.

---

**Prompt 43**

> Write a LinkedIn post reflecting on the gap between what I thought success in [your field] would look like and what it actually looks like. I want to be honest about both the good and the uncomfortable parts. Tone: reflective, not complaining. Under 220 words. End with a question.

**When to use it:** "What success actually looks like" posts resonate because they validate the quiet doubts many professionals feel when reality does not match expectation.

---

**Prompt 44**

> Write a LinkedIn post about how my definition of [career / leadership / success / work-life balance] has changed over the years. Where I started: [your starting view]. Where I am now: [your current view]. What changed it: [brief explanation]. Tone: thoughtful and a little vulnerable. End with a question.

**When to use it:** Belief-change posts signal maturity and openness to growth, which builds trust. They also invite readers to share how their own views have evolved, creating rich comment threads.

---

**Prompt 45**

> Write a LinkedIn post about the best career advice I ever received and whether I still believe it. The advice was [quote or paraphrase it]. My view of it now: [your current take]. I want the post to be thoughtful rather than either blindly endorsing or dismissing the advice. End with a question asking for the best advice readers have received.

**When to use it:** Best advice posts generate long comment threads because almost everyone has advice they have received that they want to share or revisit. Providing your own nuanced take on a piece of advice makes the post more interesting than a simple endorsement.

---

**Prompt 46**

> Write a LinkedIn post sharing what I wish someone had told me about [salary negotiation / job searching / managing people / working remotely / starting a business]. Give [number] specific, actionable insights. My audience is [describe]. Avoid vague advice. End with a question inviting readers to add their own.

**When to use it:** "What nobody tells you about" posts are consistently high-performers because they promise inside knowledge. The format works across any professional topic where conventional advice tends to be vague or incomplete.

---

**Prompt 47**

> Write a LinkedIn post about a moment when I realized I had grown significantly in my career. The moment was [describe it specifically]. I want to reflect on it in a way that is honest about how long growth actually takes. Under 200 words. End with a question about defining moments for my readers.

**When to use it:** Growth reflection posts are quieter and more personal than achievement posts, which makes them feel more authentic. They tend to attract thoughtful, longer comments.

---

## How to Customize These Prompts for Your Niche

A general prompt produces general output. To get posts that sound like you and speak to your specific audience, make these four edits every time:

**1. Name your audience specifically.** Instead of "my audience is professionals," write "my audience is early-career software engineers switching into product management." The more precisely you describe who you are writing for, the more targeted the output.

**2. Inject a specific fact, number, or example.** If a prompt asks you to describe a challenge you faced, give the actual challenge — not a sanitized version. "I struggled with leading a distributed team for the first time" produces a better post than "I faced leadership challenges."

**3. Specify your field and role.** "I work in B2B SaaS sales as a regional account executive" gives the model far more to work with than "I work in sales." Industry-specific language, examples, and reference points make posts feel authentic rather than generic.

**4. Set the word count.** LinkedIn posts perform best between 150 and 300 words for most formats. Add "Keep the post under [number] words" to your prompt to avoid outputs that are too long to read on mobile.

For additional guidance on what makes LinkedIn content visible to more people, the [LinkedIn algorithm guide](/blog/linkedin-algorithm-tips-increase-post-reach) explains which post characteristics get boosted in the feed.

## How to Refine AI Output After Generating

Generating a first draft is the start of the process, not the end. Here is a simple four-step review to make every AI-generated post stronger before you publish:

### Step 1: Read It Out Loud

If a sentence sounds like a corporate memo when spoken aloud, rewrite it. The standard for LinkedIn posts is natural, conversational language — the way you would explain something to a colleague, not how you would write a performance review.

### Step 2: Add One Personal Detail

Find the most generic sentence in the output and replace it with something only you could write. A specific number, a real person's name (with permission), a date, a location, a dollar figure. That single specific detail makes the whole post feel authentic.

### Step 3: Sharpen the Hook

Read the first line of the generated post. Ask: would I stop scrolling for this? If not, rewrite it. Strong hooks are specific, create curiosity, or make a bold claim. Weak hooks start with "I" or tell the reader what the post is about before the post is about it.

### Step 4: Check the Question

Every post should end with a question or a clear invitation to comment. If the AI wrote "I hope this was helpful," replace it with a specific question that invites a real answer. The goal is to make it as easy as possible for readers to leave a comment.

Once your copy is polished, use the preview tool to check [text formatting](/blog/linkedin-posts-text-formatting), confirm the post reads well on both desktop and mobile, and review your [hashtag strategy](/blog/linkedin-hashtags-complete-guide) before publishing.

You should also think about timing. Even a well-crafted post will underperform if it goes live when your audience is not on the platform — the [best times to post on LinkedIn](/blog/best-times-to-post-on-linkedin) guide breaks down when different professional audiences are most active.

## Putting It All Together

You now have a library of 47 prompts covering five of the most effective content categories on LinkedIn. The process for using them is straightforward:

1. Choose the category that matches what you want to say today
2. Copy the prompt and replace the brackets with your specific details
3. Paste it into the AI generator, select a tone, and generate
4. Apply the four-step review above
5. Format the post, preview it, and publish at the right time

Consistency matters more than perfection. A post that is 80 percent as good as your ideal post published today is worth far more than a perfect post that never goes live. Use these prompts to remove the friction of the blank page and get your ideas in front of your audience.
