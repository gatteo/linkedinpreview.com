## Introduction

Strikethrough text is a great way to show updates or make corrections to your LinkedIn posts without removing the original text. This can be particularly useful for maintaining transparency in your communications. Since LinkedIn does not support text formatting like strikethrough directly, using external tools such as [linkedinpreview.com](https://linkedinpreview.com/#tool) can help you achieve this effect.
