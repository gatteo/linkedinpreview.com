## Introduction

When it comes to professional networking on LinkedIn, the way your posts look can greatly influence the impression you make. Effective text formatting helps you communicate your message clearly and make it stand out in a crowded feed. Unfortunately, LinkedIn itself doesn’t offer much in the way of rich text formatting. This is where tools like [linkedinpreview.com](https://linkedinpreview.com/#tool) come into play, allowing you to enhance your LinkedIn posts with various formatting options before they go live.

## Available Text Formats on LinkedIn

**Bold**: Using bold text in your posts can make your key messages jump off the page. It’s a powerful tool for drawing attention to important statements.

**Italics**: Italics are great for emphasizing specific parts of your text or for quotes, adding a subtle highlight without being overbearing.

**Underline**: Underlining can add another layer of emphasis, especially useful in headers or important terms.

**Bold Italics**: Sometimes you need to stress something with a bit more punch. Combining bold and italics can give your text a compelling edge.

**Strikethrough**: This format is handy for showing updates or corrections, indicating that something has changed without removing the original text.

**Bold Underline**: Bold combined with underline can make certain phrases or sentences in your post really stand out, useful for titles or calls to action.

**Bold Strikethrough**: Using bold strikethrough can be an eye-catching way to communicate updates or changes to your audience.
