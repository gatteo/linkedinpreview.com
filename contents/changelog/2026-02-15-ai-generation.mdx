summary: 'Generate LinkedIn posts with AI assistance directly in the editor'
---

You can now generate LinkedIn posts using AI right from the editor. Click the magic wand icon in the toolbar to open the generation panel, describe what you want to write about, and get a full draft in seconds.

The generator is designed for LinkedIn specifically - it writes in a natural, professional tone without the robotic phrasing that makes AI-written content obvious. You can iterate on the result, edit it freely, and use all the usual formatting tools on the output.

Generation works best when you give it a clear topic or angle. A sentence or two of context is usually enough. For example: "Write about why async work matters for remote teams" or "Share a lesson I learned from launching a product too early."

The feature is available in all editor variants, including the embeddable version.
