summary: 'Share your post drafts with anyone via a simple URL'
---

You can now share your post drafts with anyone via a URL. Click the share button in the editor toolbar to generate a link. Anyone with the link can open your draft and see it exactly as you wrote it.

The draft is encoded directly in the URL using compression - no account required, no data stored on any server. The link works immediately and doesn't expire.

This is useful for getting feedback before publishing. Share the link with a colleague or a friend, let them review the formatting and content in the preview, and paste their suggested edits back into your editor.

Links include the full post content including formatting and any attached media. For posts with large images or videos, the URL may be long - but it will still work in any modern browser.
