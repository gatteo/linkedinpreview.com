The initial public release of LinkedIn Preview. The core editor and preview panel were already in place - this release added the first layer of polish and content infrastructure.

## What's New

- **Image Upload** - Upload images directly in the editor panel to preview how media posts will render on LinkedIn, including correct aspect ratio handling
- **SEO Structured Data** - Added schema.org markup (Organization, WebSite, SoftwareApplication) to homepage for better search engine visibility
- **404 Page** - Custom 404 page with helpful navigation so users who land on a broken URL aren't left stranded
- **Blog Posts** - Published the first set of LinkedIn formatting guides covering bold text, italic text, bullet lists, numbered lists, strikethrough, and underline

## Improvements

- **Footer Links** - Updated footer navigation to include links to new blog content and key pages
