summary: 'Preview your posts with images and videos attached'

You can now upload images and videos to see exactly how your media posts will look before publishing. The preview renders your media at the correct dimensions and placement - just as LinkedIn displays it.

Images are shown in LinkedIn's standard 1.91:1 ratio for single images, and the preview handles portrait and landscape images correctly. Video thumbnails are shown with the play button overlay LinkedIn uses.

To add media, click the image or video icon in the editor toolbar, or drag and drop a file directly into the editor. Supported formats are JPG, PNG, GIF, and MP4.

Media is stored locally in your browser and is never uploaded to any server. When you share a draft via URL, the media is encoded directly in the link - so the recipient sees your full post including attachments.
