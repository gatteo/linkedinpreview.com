summary: 'See how your post looks in a realistic LinkedIn feed with surrounding posts, sidebar, and full layout'
---

We've launched a new **Feed Preview** page that shows your LinkedIn post exactly as it would appear in a real feed - complete with surrounding posts, the LinkedIn sidebar, and the full page layout.

Previously the preview showed your post in isolation. That made it easy to check formatting, but harder to judge how it would actually feel to a reader scrolling through their feed. The new Feed Preview puts your post in context.

The feed includes placeholder posts above and below yours so you can see relative proportions, font sizes, and how your hook line competes for attention. The sidebar mirrors LinkedIn's right-hand panel layout, giving you the full picture.

To access it, write your post as usual and click "Feed Preview" in the toolbar. Your draft is preserved when switching between views.
