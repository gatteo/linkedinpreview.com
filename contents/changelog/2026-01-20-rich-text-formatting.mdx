summary: 'Format your posts with bold, italic, underline, strikethrough, and lists'

The editor now supports a full set of rich text formatting options: **bold**, _italic_, underline, ~~strikethrough~~, bullet lists, and numbered lists.

LinkedIn doesn't use standard HTML formatting - it uses Unicode character ranges to display bold and italic text. The editor handles this automatically: write your content using familiar keyboard shortcuts, and the preview shows exactly how it will appear on LinkedIn.

The toolbar above the editor gives you one-click access to all formatting options. Keyboard shortcuts work too - `Cmd+B` for bold, `Cmd+I` for italic, `Cmd+U` for underline. Lists can be started with `-` or `1.` at the beginning of a line.

Formatting is preserved when you copy your post to the clipboard, so you can paste directly into LinkedIn without losing any styling.
