A new full-page feed preview lets you see exactly how your post will appear alongside other posts in the LinkedIn feed - on both desktop and mobile.

## What's New

- **Feed Preview Page** - A dedicated `/preview` page renders your post inside a realistic LinkedIn feed layout. Placeholder posts, a simulated LinkedIn header, sidebars, and a "Start a post" bar surround your content so you can judge how it reads in context
- **Desktop & Mobile Modes** - Toggle between desktop and mobile views, or let the page match your current viewport. On mobile, sidebars hide and the feed narrows to a single column. On desktop, the full three-column LinkedIn layout is shown
- **Share Feed Preview** - Share a direct link to the feed preview of your post. Recipients see the same realistic feed layout without needing to paste anything into the editor

## Improvements

- **Preview Buttons Visibility** - The "Open realistic feed preview" button in the editor now only appears once you have written content, reducing clutter on empty editors
- **Responsive Polish** - Fixed layout issues across multiple screen sizes including hero text sizing, features grid alignment, embed section illustration visibility, and preview panel link overflow on small screens
