AuthoredUp is a LinkedIn-focused content tool that combines a post editor with analytics, templates, and a content library. It includes a free LinkedIn post preview generator as one of its features, but its full value comes from the paid subscription that unlocks analytics, saved drafts, and content planning.

LinkedIn Preview is a completely free alternative that covers the core use case - writing, formatting, and previewing LinkedIn posts - without any paywall or account requirement.
