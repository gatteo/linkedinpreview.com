Supergrow is an AI-first LinkedIn growth tool that helps creators write posts, repurpose content, schedule updates, and track their growth.

## What is Supergrow?

Supergrow markets itself as an AI-powered content engine for LinkedIn. It uses AI to help users:

- **Generate and repurpose posts**: Turn blog posts, videos, or URLs into LinkedIn content.
- **Schedule posts**: Plan and auto-publish to LinkedIn.
- **Track engagement**: Monitor which posts perform best.
- **Inspiration feeds**: Browse trending content in your niche.

Supergrow is built for creators who want to maintain a consistent posting schedule without spending hours writing every week.

## Pricing

Supergrow has a free tier with significant usage limits on AI generation. Paid plans start around $19/month and increase based on usage and team size. Full access to scheduling, analytics, and unlimited AI generation requires a subscription.

## When to Use Supergrow

Supergrow is the right choice if you:

- Want to automate your LinkedIn publishing workflow end-to-end.
- Need to repurpose content from other channels into LinkedIn posts at scale.
- Are willing to pay for AI generation beyond a limited free quota.
- Want detailed analytics on your LinkedIn content performance.

## When to Use LinkedIn Preview

LinkedIn Preview is the better choice when you:

- Need a free formatting and preview tool with no usage limits.
- Want to use AI to generate LinkedIn posts without paying for a subscription.
- Need to preview your post across mobile, tablet, and desktop in a realistic feed layout.
- Want to share a draft with someone via URL without them needing an account.
- Do not want to create an account just to check how a post will look.

LinkedIn Preview's AI generation is free with no monthly limits - write as many posts as you want.

## Conclusion

Supergrow is a strong choice for creators who want a full-featured AI workflow from generation to scheduling. But it requires an account and has meaningful usage limits on the free tier. LinkedIn Preview gives you unlimited AI post generation, complete rich text formatting, and realistic feed preview - all free, no sign-up needed.
