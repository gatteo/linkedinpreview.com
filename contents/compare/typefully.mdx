## What is Typefully?

Typefully is a writing-first social media tool that emphasizes quality writing over everything else. Its core features include:

- **Distraction-free editor**: Clean interface for writing long-form LinkedIn posts and X threads.
- **Scheduling**: Queue posts to publish at optimal times.
- **AI rewriting**: Improve drafts with AI suggestions.
- **Analytics**: Track impressions, engagement, and follower growth.
- **Multi-platform**: Manage content for both X and LinkedIn from one place.

Typefully appeals to writers and content creators who cross-post to X and LinkedIn and want a unified workflow.

## Pricing

Typefully has a free tier with limited scheduling slots and basic features. Full access to scheduling, analytics, and AI assistance starts at around $12.5/month for the Creator plan, with higher tiers for teams.

## When to Use Typefully

Typefully is a good fit if you:

- Create content for both X and LinkedIn and want one tool for both.
- Value a minimal, distraction-free writing experience.
- Need scheduling and do not want to use a larger platform like Buffer or Hootsuite.
- Want basic analytics to see what resonates with your audience.

## When to Use LinkedIn Preview

LinkedIn Preview is the better choice when you:

- Need LinkedIn-specific text formatting: bold, italic, underline, strikethrough, and bulleted or numbered lists.
- Want to see your post in a realistic LinkedIn feed simulation - not just a generic preview.
- Need to use AI to generate posts for free, without a subscription.
- Want to share a formatted draft via URL, not via a shared account.
- Do not need a multi-platform tool - just a great LinkedIn writing experience.

LinkedIn Preview is purpose-built for LinkedIn. Typefully is a general social writing tool; LinkedIn is secondary to its core X-focused experience.

## Conclusion

Typefully is a solid choice for creators who write for multiple platforms and want scheduling and analytics in a clean interface. For LinkedIn-specific work, LinkedIn Preview offers richer formatting, better preview fidelity, free AI generation, and no sign-up friction. If LinkedIn is your primary platform, LinkedIn Preview is the more purpose-built, more affordable option.
