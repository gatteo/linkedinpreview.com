- Want to format a post with bold, italic, underline, or strikethrough text before copying it to LinkedIn.
- Need to see exactly how your post will look on mobile, tablet, or desktop before publishing.
- Want to use AI to generate post ideas without paying for a subscription.
- Do not want to create an account or share any personal information.
- Want to share a draft with a colleague or client via a simple URL.

LinkedIn Preview is free forever and requires no sign-up. It handles everything from the moment you start writing to the moment you copy your polished post to LinkedIn.

## Conclusion

Taplio and LinkedIn Preview solve different problems. Taplio is a comprehensive platform for serious LinkedIn growth, but it costs $49-$149/month and requires an account. LinkedIn Preview is a free, instant formatting and preview tool that anyone can use without registering.

If you just need to write, format, preview, and generate LinkedIn posts - LinkedIn Preview does it better and for free.
