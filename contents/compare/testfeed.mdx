TestFeed is a free LinkedIn post preview tool that lets you see how a post will appear in the LinkedIn feed. Its unique feature is an engagement simulation that shows how your post might look with likes and comments. It is aimed at creators who want a quick gut-check before publishing.

LinkedIn Preview covers the same use case and goes significantly further: full rich text formatting, AI post generation, multi-device previews, image and video upload, and sharable draft URLs - all free.

## What is TestFeed?

TestFeed is a straightforward, no-account LinkedIn preview tool. Its main offering is:

- **Feed simulation**: Preview how your post will look inside a LinkedIn feed, including the card layout and text truncation.
- **Engagement preview**: See a simulated version of your post with likes and comment counts to visualize how it might look with engagement.
- **Quick paste-and-preview**: Paste or type your post text and instantly see a preview.

TestFeed is designed for a single, narrow use case: checking post appearance before publishing.

## Pricing

Both TestFeed and LinkedIn Preview are free. Neither requires a subscription.

## When to Use TestFeed

TestFeed may appeal to you if you:

- Want a very simple tool with a minimal interface.
- Are specifically interested in the engagement simulation feature.
- Already format your text in another tool and just need a quick preview check.

## When to Use LinkedIn Preview

LinkedIn Preview is the better choice when you:

- Need to format your post with bold, italic, underline, strikethrough, or lists before previewing.
- Want AI to help generate or rewrite your post content.
- Need to preview across mobile, tablet, and desktop screen sizes.
- Want to upload and preview an image or video alongside your post.
- Want to share a draft with a colleague via a URL before finalizing.
- Prefer an open-source tool you can inspect or self-host.

LinkedIn Preview handles the full journey from blank page to polished post ready to copy to LinkedIn.

## Conclusion

TestFeed and LinkedIn Preview are both free, no-login tools for previewing LinkedIn posts. TestFeed has a narrow focus and a fun engagement simulation feature. LinkedIn Preview is a more complete tool: it handles writing, formatting, AI generation, multi-device preview, image upload, and draft sharing. For anyone who wants more than a quick preview check, LinkedIn Preview is the stronger option.
